  - Format protocols better, grab as much data as possible
  - Decode data
  - Place content in a JSON to be accessed by the frontend
- UI
  - To be done once features are done, connect frontend and backend and make it all look nice
- ARP tables
  - Place content in a JSON to be accessed by the frontend
- DNS tables (maybe)
- whoami information
  - Place content in a JSON to be accessed by the frontend
  - Determine who to gather information for (using nmap maybe?)
  - Loop through hosts and gather information on them
